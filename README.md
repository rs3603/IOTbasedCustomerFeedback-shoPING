Using the ShoPING device, customers eyeing a product can conveniently choose among 3-5 pre-defined options to give feedback on the product. This provides an interactive interface between the shopkeeper and the customers that provides valuable information which strongly supplements sales data. This in turn helps the shopkeeper in making smart business decisions and efficiently cater his/her products towards the majority customer feedback data.
